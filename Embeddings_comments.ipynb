    "30–150  cm long with a stem between 0.5 and\n",

    "may be grown without fertilizers or pesticides\n",
    "(UNODC, 1953a; Ray et al., 2006; Pushpangadan\n",
    "et al., 2012). Traditionally, most highland and\n",
    "upland farmers in south-eastern Asia have not\n",
    "used fertilizers for any of their crops, but opium\n",
    "poppy farmers have started using both natural\n",
    "and chemical fertilizers to increase opium poppy\n",
    "yields in recent years. Chicken manure, human\n",
    "faeces, or bat droppings are mixed into the\n",
    "planting soil. Opium poppy seeds are planted by\n",
    "the end of October. After 1 month, some plants\n",
    "are removed and 8–18  plants/m2 are left. Most\n",
    "opium poppy varieties in south-eastern Asia\n",
    "produce three to five mature pods per plant.\n",
    "Harvesting is done in February, about 2  weeks\n",
    "after the flower petals fall from the pods (DEA,\n",
    "1992). All parts of plants of the Papaver genus are\n",
    "characterized by watery and milky latex, except\n",
    "the seeds.\n",
    "1.1.3 Opium composition and forms\n",
    "(a) Opium composition\n",
    "Opium has a complex chemical composition\n",
    "consisting of sugars, proteins, fats, water, meconic\n",
    "acid, plant wax, latex, gum, ammonia, sulfuric\n",
    "and lactic acids, and at least 25 alkaloids (Fig. 1.2;\n",
    "Pushpangadan et al., 2012; Labanca et al., 2018).\n",
    "The composition of opium is further discussed\n",
    "in Section 4.1. The alkaloids are categorized into\n",
    "two main chemical classes: phenanthrenes and\n",
    "benzylisoquinolines (Yaksh & Wallace, 2018).\n",
    "The types and percentages of these alkaloids\n",
    "differ widely in different poppy cultivars. Also,\n",
    "differences in seed yield per plant and latex yield\n",
    "per plant have been reported (Solanki et al., 2017;\n",
    "Labanca et al., 2018). The principal phenanthrenes are morphine, codeine, and thebaine\n",
    "(Yaksh & Wallace, 2018). Morphine is the most\n",
    "abundant phenanthrene in opium. The metabolites of thebaine, an intermediate of morphine\n",
    "biosynthesis in poppy plants, include thebaol\n",
    "and oripavine (WHO, 2006; Megutnishvili et al.,\n",
    "2018).\n",
    "The principal benzylisoquinolines are papaverine and noscapine (Frick et al., 2005;\n",
    "Beaudoin & Facchini, 2014; Labanca et al., 2018;\n",
    "Yaksh & Wallace, 2018).\n",
    "(b) Composition of different forms of opium\n",
    "The main forms of opium are raw or crude\n",
    "opium, opium dross, refined opium, and other\n",
    "derivatives.\n",
    "(i) Raw or crude opium\n",
    "Raw or crude opium is the unprocessed\n",
    "dried latex of the poppy seedpod and is a dark\n",
    "and sticky substance (Fig.  1.3; Khademi et al.,\n",
    "2012). Alkaloids are major components of crude\n",
    "opium. Among all alkaloids, the most abundant\n",
    "is morphine (10–12% of crude opium by weight).\n",
    "The other alkaloids – including thebaine,\n",
    "codeine, papaverine, noscapine, narcotine,\n",
    "and narceine (UNODC, 1953a; Labanca et al.,\n",
    "2018), together with morphine – make up about\n",
    "25% of the weight of crude opium, as shown in\n",
    "Table 1.1. Sterols such as cycloartenol and β-sitosterol (Malaveille et al., 1982) are also present\n",
    "in raw opium. [The Working Group noted that\n",
    "the expression of the morphine content of opium\n",
    "as a percentage depends in part on the moisture\n",
    "content.] After the opium has been collected, the\n",
    "moisture content is usually ~30%. Commercial\n",
    "opium usually has a moisture content of ~10–15%.\n",
    "Opium that is apparently dry still retains considerable moisture (~6%) (UNODC, 1953a). Raw\n",
    "opium is often adulterated with other substances,\n",
    "for example, starch (37%) and strontium sulfate\n",
    "were reported in Mexican opium (Sodi Pallares\n",
    "& Meyran Garcia, 1954); arsenic in Indian\n",
    "opium (Datta & Kaul, 1977; Narang et al., 1987);\n",
    "and arsenic and strychnine in Sri Lankan opium\n",
    "(Wijesekera et al., 1988). More recently, traded\n",
    "opium in Iran has been shown to be contaminated with heavy metals such as lead, chromium,\n",
    "cadmium, and thallium, and bacteria such as\n",
    "Clostridium tetani, Enterobacter cloacae, and\n",
    "Pantoea agglomerans (Ghaderi & Afshari, 2016;\n",
    "Aghababaei et al., 2018; Ghane et al., 2018).\n",
    "(ii) Opium dross\n",
    "Dross is produced by scraping away the\n",
    "tarry residues that accumulate on the inside\n",
    "walls of the opium pipe as a result of incomplete \n",
    "combustion of raw opium. The dross is black,\n",
    "dry, and granular (Meysamie et al., 2009). Each\n",
    "gram of opium yields 0.3  g of dross (Siassi &\n",
    "Fozouni, 1980). The summary content of the five\n",
    "main alkaloids in opium dross is less than their\n",
    "summary content in raw opium (see Table 1.1).\n",
    "This pyrolysed opium (Meysamie et al., 2009),\n",
    "unlike raw opium, contains primary aromatic\n",
    "amines, heterocyclic (nitrogen-containing)\n",
    "aromatic compounds, and polycyclic aromatic\n",
    "hydrocarbons.\n",
    "(iii) Refined opium or opium sap\n",
    "Refined opium or opium sap is the (minimally) refined product of opium and is prepared\n",
    "by boiling opium dross with or without raw\n",
    "opium in water for several hours. The solution\n",
    "is then filtered, insoluble parts are separated,\n",
    "and the excess water is left to evaporate. The\n",
    "final product is brown, sticky, and shiny (Kalant,\n",
    "1997; Meysamie et al., 2009; Khademi et al., 2012;\n",
    "Nikfarjam et al., 2016). The summary alkaloid\n",
    "content in minimally refined opium is about the\n",
    "same as in raw opium (see Table 1.1).\n",
    "(iv) Other opium derivatives\n",
    "Other opium derivatives include the pure\n",
    "alkaloids like morphine and codeine; semisynthetic opiates like heroin, compact-heroin,\n",
    "and buprenorphine; and crystal and synthetic\n",
    "opioids like fentanyl, methadone, and pethidine.\n",
    "This group of opium derivative drugs is outside\n",
    "of the scope of this monograph (see Section 1.1.1,\n",

    "6.5 Rationale\n",
    "The evaluation of opium consumption (i.e.\n",
    "smoking or ingestion) as Group 1 is based on a\n",
    "determination of sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in humans. In reaching this determination, the Working Group noted that in a cohort\n",
    "study of 50  045 adults in Golestan Province, a\n",
    "north-eastern province of the Islamic Republic\n",
    "of Iran, self-reported opium consumption was\n",
    "assessed at baseline, validated with urinary\n",
    "levels of opium metabolites, and the cohort was\n",
    "followed for more than a decade to ascertain incident cancers. The risk of several types of cancer –\n",
    "including cancers of the urinary bladder, larynx,\n",
    "and lung – was significantly higher among opium\n",
    "users than non-users and increased in an exposure-dependent fashion with cumulative opium\n",
    "use. The prospective cohort design minimized\n",
    "concerns regarding selection bias and reverse\n",
    "causation, and the detailed assessment of demographic, socioeconomic, and lifestyle factors\n",
    "addressed concerns regarding the major potential\n",
    "confounders of the associations of interest. These\n",
